# **FAQ**
Welcome to the most frequently asked, and burning questions asked in r/DirtyChatPals. Please read through this guide before reaching out to us, as your answer maybe already here. This is an added extra to our [**rules wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyChatPals/wiki/rules/). Why? Because we find that most people have a better experience in our Subreddit if they are aware of the expectations. 

- **Please note:** ignorance is not an excuse in DCP. We have created these resources specifically so that you have no reason to ponder, or complain, why your post was not successful, filtered, or you were banned.  



## **What does a post in DCP look like?**

For all those first timers, here is a good example of what your post should look like to pass the filter.

- Age Tag Title Titillation kinks/limits  

>**30 [M4F] Space Scoundrel Seeks Co-Pilot for Love and Laughs (and Space-Ribs!)**  

>Can you banter like a pro and keep up with my sass? A charming smuggler seeks someone to text as I pilot the Millennium Falcon. Must be quick on the draw, even quicker with a witty remark. And tolerant of Chewie's occasional shedding. Are you up for adventure, whether it's chasing bounties across the galaxy or deciphering ancient texts, though maybe skip the booby traps, (I still have a scar from that last temple run.) So, if you're looking for love, laughter, and maybe a touch of danger, buckle up and blast off with the smoothest operator in the galaxy. Send your holovids to my Reddit Chat, and may the Kessel Run be with you!  

>Kinks: praise, sass, Corellian ale, space-ribs  
Limits: snakes, sith lords, bounty hunters  

## **Why was my post removed?**

The comment below your removal has explained why we removed it. **Have you read it?**   

Further, do not delete posts, this is suspicious. Read the removal message and make a new post that still adheres to the post limit rule. Posts are rarely removed in error; and bot removed ones will not be approved. Chances are it's a word or phrase you used. 
Please do not message the mod team until you read the comment, & the FAQ. We will literally link you to this page if youIf after all that you can not figure it out, we are happy to hear about it.

## **My post was removed for my hard limit, why?**

There are some limits, in our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyChatPals/wiki/rules/) already, that you just do not need to type out. These include, but not limited to:

- Under-age - please do not use this as a limit, it is obvious; only use: **All participants must be 18+**.
- Bestiality - we do not allow anything with animals, no need to say it.
- Age-gap - do not use this, be specific with your kink (please see DD/LG, & Age related words below)

## **Can I post, and link, to my snapchat/discord/instagram/Facebook profile?**

No, **and yet again *NO*!!** If we see any other chat app, social media, session key, or server in your post you will be banned. *Instantly.* This is to keep everyone safe. As soon as you leave Reddit, you place your privacy at risk. 
Please read our [sextortion](https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyChatPals/wiki/sextortion/) for how to stay safe, what makes a scam account, and what to do when you are silly enough to leave Reddit and get blackmailed. If you encounter anyone in chat that is trying to take you off of reddit, use the report button or preferably take a screenshot and a link to their account, and send us a modmail message with that.

## **Can I post multiple times to your sub?**

We have a: 2 posts in every 24 hours, bot enforced rule. Please do not try to post past this limit as we tend to see that as spam, and we will ban you for it, depending on how many times you posted.
Deleted posts (both by automod or by your own deleting action) count towards this, so once you have posted twice, wait 24 hours before posting again.

## **Why is my flair yellow?**

Your flair has been turned yellow as someone in the community reported you for breaking one of our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyChatPals/wiki/rules/). It means that was your last chance in our sub. If we filter one more post after that flair, you will be banned.

## **Why is my flair purple?**

Your flair has been turned purple as a mod has removed a post, or seen a post removed, for breaking one of our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyChatPals/wiki/rules/). It means that was your last chance in our sub. If we filter one more post after that flair, you will be banned.

## **How much Karma do I need?**

We do not tell you how much you need to post here. You can thank the users that have abused this knowledge to get in quickly to post. Go earn your karma the normal way. Do not use karma upvote subs, as we will use that to determine what type of Reddit community member you are.

## **What are the most common post removals?**

- **Spam** - If you have posted the same script more than two times, that is spam, and you will have your flair changed if we have to remove it.
- **Low effort** - Your post needs details, sentences, and punctuation. Anything less is actively removed, and you will have your flair changed if we have to remove it.
- **Not enough detail** - You need sentences, with punctuation, and details in order to post in DCP. Please take a look at other posts to get an idea before posting yours.
- **Gender Tags** - the format is simple: square brackets, with a *gender* followed by the **number four** then *gender*.   
 - Ex. [F4M] or [MF4A] or [TF4M] etc. 

There is a very helpful bot message on all of these removals, read it *before* messaging us.

## **How many removals am I allowed in DCP?**

- We allow for 3 bot filtered posts; 2 reported posts; and only 2 mod removed posts. 

Each post we remove, either by bot or mod, is accompanied by a comment and a messaged warning. Take these warnings seriously. If you keep posting the same thing over, and we keep removing it, you will face further mod action, and face a ban.

## **Can I post DD/LG or Mommy kink posts in your sub?**

Yes, however, with one caveat: **All participants must be 18+** is required at the *top* of the post. If we do not see that, and your post is borderline under-age content, we will remove it and further mod action will be taken. 

## **Can I share, or ask for, pictures or information of gf/bf/wife/husband or anyone else?**

If you post asking for gf/wives/bf/husband etc. pictures or information. Or if you offer to share your gf/wife/bf/husband with user in this some, it will be removed. In fact, if you offer to share (or ask for) details, pictures, or information that could be harmful due to privacy concerns we will remove it. This will be followed by a ban, and a report to Admin.

## **Can I copy & paste my post?**

We allow 1 copy and paste post of a prompt. Anything more than this is considered [spam](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043504051-What-constitutes-spam-Am-I-a-spammer). Make each post unique, detailed, and on point to your message.

## **Can I sell in your sub?**

No, we do not allow sellers, as our community members are fed up with clicking through your spam posts only to be told they need to pay to chat. You will face an instant ban if we see you selling.  
We also use reporting for selling in posts, as a removal.

## **Can I join the sub with my Alt. account?**

It depends. Were you banned from our sub? Then no. Were you banned by Reddit? Then no. We do not allow Ban evasion accounts in our sub. Neither does Reddit take kindly to users circumventing a ban. So behave, be civil, and all will be well.

## **Can I verify in your sub?**

Yes. We will need a few things in place before you are allowed. Please see our [verification wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyChatPals/wiki/verification/) for more.
- Caveat: we do not verify accounts with negative karma, removals, or certian types of posts & behaviour.

## **Why was my post removed for age related words?**

We do not allow words that relate to: age gap relationships, school, certain types of Hentai, and shows that are made up of under-age characters. This rule covers a lot of common situations.   

- If you ask for RP, or IRL, about a taboo relationship, you better make sure there is a disclaimer on your post of - **All participants must be 18+**.  
- Schoolgirls/boys, young girls/boys, are by their very nature under-age words. We do not allow these, and many other words like it, in DCP. If you are filtered with this rule, you will face a ban and an Admin report.

## **Can I post as a Female, if I am Male?**

No, be authentic, be you. 

Users in DCP expect what is written on the post in terms of gender. If you are reported for posting as the opposite gender to what you are, it will mean a ban for Impersonation, and a report to Reddit. Do not catfish people.

## **I am non-binary, how do I tag my post?**

We do not allow discrimination in DCP, so if you are trans or non-binary, be proud and use the amazing array of gender tags that Reddit has to post. One side note, we find that posts that use [F4M], when you are trans/non-binary, do get reported for Impersonation. So please make it clear, in the post or in the tags. To help, this is a non-exhaustive, list of tags that are available:  

- Trans
- Non-binary
- FTM
- MTF
- NB

## **Can we post as a couple?**

Yes!   

However, if we find that it is just one partner posting all the time, and the other partner only posts occasionally, we will ask you to verify. That will mean both of you in the picture, holding a sign, with the current date, and time we asked in modmail, on it. Anything less will see you banned for impersonation.  

- Also do not use your partner as bait for posts in our subs, if you clearly are posting like this we will ban and report you for privacy and Impersonation.

## **Can I post asking for IRL meet ups?**

No, please do not post like this.

We do not allow personals advert as this sub is only for dirty minds and words. There are far better subs to post these sorts of posts in. We will remove your post, and change your flair as a warning. If you ignore that, we will ban you.

## **Can I use, or ask for, AI pictures or words in my posts?**

No, we do not allow AI use in our sub.  There are privacy concerns with it, as well as the obvious impersonation abilities. If we find that you have used it in our sub, you will face further mod action, and a ban.

- Do not use AI to generate your posts and spam the sub, either. This will be a ban, as you are not being genuine, and you are spamming.

## **They asked to see me nude, with my face in the picture; is it ok?**

No. they will blackmail you. 

Do not send any naked pictures that you are not happy to possibly have outed on the internet. Especially not if your face is in them. If you see posts, or come across someone asking for this, please report to the mod team using the report buttons or send a modmail message.

## **They said Reddit is not safe, and we need to chat on Instagram, is that ok?**

No! A thousand times, ***NO***. 

Do not leave reddit for any other chat platform, especially Instagram, Telegram or Whatsapp. You will easily leak your personal information, and in worst case scenario your location. Blackmail on Reddit is big business, and in every case we deal with, the victim has either:

- Left Reddit chat,
- Sent a nude with their face in,
- Used a personal account,
- Given away personal identifying information or social account.

**DO NOT LEAVE REDDIT CHAT!!**

If you encounter anyone in chat that is trying to take you off of reddit, use the report button or preferably take a screenshot and a link to their account, and send us a modmail message with that.

## **Can you approve my post, the bot 'mistakenly' blocked it?**

No. We do not manually approve posts that the bots have removed. Why? As the bot learns every time we do that that. Plus our filters are tried and true tested, and rarely make mistakes, no matter what you think.

## **Why can't I comment on a post I like?**

*Comments are locked* in this sub, we only allow Reddit chat feature to connect with other users. Do not comment on a post as you may end up with further mod action, especially if the comment breaks Rule 1 of DCP.

## **Can I post a blackmail Role Play in DCP?**

No, you can not.

We have enough issues with real blackmail, without any posts that may inspire or  encourage this sort of behaviour. we generally look at this on a post by post basis. However if you are wanting personal information, or pictures, or access to someone's phone, or private, life or socials. WE will remove and possibly even ban you.

## **Why was my post removed for Ban Evasion?**

Because Reddit does not allow Ban Evasion accounts.

If your post was removed for being a Ban Evasion account, we can not help you. Reddit has powerful filters that are able to pick up when you use two or three or more accounts. If you were banned from our sub once, and tried to post with another account, your posts will be flagged as such. We do not allow Ban Evasion accounts in our sub, which means you will be banned again. So our advice is please respect our community Rules and do not get banned in the first place. Do not compound it by returning with another account. If you have an issue with this, please message Admin.

## **Why was my Caption post removed?**

Wrong sub! We do not allow caption posts in this sub.

You cannot ask people to send pictures to use for captions in our sub, as it breaks [Reddit's Policy - Rule 3](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Even if you have added a - *with consent* - disclaimer in it. We are not a caption or pic exchange sub. Posting like this will see you banned and reported to Admin for violation of Privacy.

## **I asked for face pics in my post, and it was removed for a scam, why?**

It was removed as this is a tactic used across Reddit to blackmail users.

You are not allowed to ask for face pics in a post in DCP, we consider this malicious and a prelude to blackmail. We will remove the post, and ban you if we see this in any post. If you are asked for a face pic, or see a posts that does, please report it.

## **How do I verify my email?**

Well, you really should have when you joined Reddit. But if you have not...

Upon creating an account, Reddit will email you requesting email address verification. Clicking the link within the email completes the verification process. If needed, you can request a new verification email by accessing your account settings. If your email isn't verified yet, you should see an option to "resend verification email" next to your email address. FYI, you need to do this on a computer, not your mobile.   
(Borrowed *cough cough* from this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/15krp58/how_to_verify_email/))
